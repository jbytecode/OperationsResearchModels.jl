Please

- First open an issue and share you idea
- Discuss what is your purpose, what is the implementation details
- Please provide tests from text books and any other problems that the result is known
- Use methods of `solve()` function if possible. That requires defining a structure of the given problem
- Define a struct to hold the solution
- The solution may rely on linear programming or other efficient algorithms such like in the transportation problem
